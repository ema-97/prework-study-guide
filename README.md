My motivation for this was knowing that once the prework assesments was completed I will begin the actual course and hope in the near future I can make career out of it.

I built this project to get a basic understanding of how webpages are coded and built. I als got an understanding of what each language does for web develpoment.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I like that all sections of the module containe notes about a each topic,it all alooows you to write code in your work which wouldnt normally works, but in doing so helps you understand why the code doesnt work and what you can do to fix it to get the website up and running again. For example when we opened devtools on googlechrome whilst working on Javascript, we were able to see it running and put in different element which would make it stop running.
